# 📊 Data Science Projects

This repository contains data science projects from the "[Data Scientist with Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-scientist-in-python)" course on DataCamp.

1. **Investigating Netflix Movies** 🍿
   - Apply *foundational Python skills* to answer a real-world question. The aim is to discover if Netflix's movies are getting shorter over time using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib. The user will also gain experience in an essential data science skill — exploratory data analysis.

     `pandas` `matplotlib`

2. **Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores** 📝
   - Use data manipulation and summary statistics to analyze test scores across New York City's public schools. It involves utilizing standardized test performance data from NYC's public schools to identify the schools with top math results, analyze performance variations by borough, and determine the top ten performing schools in the city.
  
     `pandas` `numpy` || `pandas - .groupby()`

3. **Visualizing the History of Nobel Prize Winners** 🎖️
   - The Nobel Prize is awarded yearly to scientists and scholars in chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace, with the first prize awarded in 1901. Are there any biases in the way the honors are awarded? Use your data manipulation and visualization skills to explore the history of this coveted prize.
  
      `pandas` `numpy` `seaborn` || `pandas - .groupby()|.value_counts()` `seaborn - .relplot()`

4. **Analyzing Crime in Los Angeles** 👮
   - Find out when and where crime is most likely to occur, along with the types of crimes commonly committed in LA. Analyze crime data to guide the Los Angeles Police Department on how they should allocate resources to protect the people of their city.
  
      `pandas` `numpy` `matplotlib` `seaborn` || `pandas - .cut()` `seaborn - .countlot()|.barplot()`

5. **Customer Analytics - Preparing Data for Modeling** 📈
   - Apply your knowledge of data types and categorical data to prepare a big dataset for modeling. Being able to create predictive models is very cool, but translating fancy models into real business value is a major challenge if the training data isn't stored efficiently. You'll convert data types, create ordered categories, and filter ordered categorical data so the data is ready for modeling.
  
      `pandas` || `pandas - .info()|.memory_usage()|.astype()`

6. **Exploring Airbnb Market Trends** 🏠
   - Apply your importing and cleaning data and data manipulation skills to explore New York City Airbnb data. New York City has a variety of Airbnb listings to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for travelers, with several different price levels, room types, and locations. In this project, you'll be able to practice your skills in importing and cleaning data and data manipulation to help you report insights to a real estate start-up.
  
      `pandas` `numpy` || `pandas - .merge()|.to_datetime()|.str.lower()|.str.replace()`

7. **Modeling Car Insurance Claim Outcomes** 🚗
   - Clean customer data and use logistic regression to predict whether people will make a claim on their car insurance.
  
      `pandas` `numpy` `statsmodels` || `statsmodels - logit()` `accuracy`

8. **Hypothesis Testing with Men's and Women's Soccer Matches** ⚽
   - Perform a hypothesis test to determine if more goals are scored in women's soccer matches than men's.
  
      `pandas` `matplotlib` `pingouin` || `hypothesis testing`

9. **Predictive Modeling for Agriculture** 🍏
   - Dive into agriculture using supervised machine learning and feature selection to aid farmers in crop cultivation and solve real-world problems. A farmer reached out to you as a machine learning expert seeking help to select the best crop for his field. Due to budget constraints, the farmer explained that he could only afford to measure one out of the four essential soil measures. The expert realized that this is a classic feature selection problem, where the objective is to pick the most important feature that could help predict the crop accurately.
  
      `pandas` `matplotlib` `sklearn` || `supervised machine learning` `skelarn - LogisticRegression()`
