You've been watching both men's and women's international soccer matches for a number of years, and your gut instinct tells you that more goals are scored in women's international football matches than men's. This would make an interesting investigative article that your subscribers are bound to love, but you'll need to perform a valid statistical hypothesis test to be sure!\n","\n","While scoping this project, you acknowledge that the sport has changed a lot over the years, and performances likely vary a lot depending on the tournament, so you decide to limit the data used in the analysis to only official `FIFA World Cup` matches (not including qualifiers) since `2002-01-01`.\n","\n","You create two datasets containing the results of every official men's and women's international football match since the 19th century, which you scraped from a reliable online source. This data is stored in two CSV files: `women_results.csv` and `men_results.csv`.\n","\n","The question you are trying to determine the answer to is:\n","\n","> Are more goals scored in women's international soccer matches than men's?\n","\n","You assume a **10% significance level**, and use the following null and alternative hypotheses:\n","\n","$H_0$ : The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is the same as men's.\n","\n","$H_A$ : The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is greater than men's."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"54ffb2a9-66e2-4126-accc-0cc2e7abf9eb","metadata":{},"source":["Perform an appropriate hypothesis test to determine the p-value, and hence result, of whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis that the mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is the same as men's.

form is ignored.\n","\n","The p-value and the result of the test must be stored in a dictionary called `result_dict` in the form:\n","\n","`result_dict = {\"p_val\": p_val, \"result\":

It's particularly useful when the assumptions of parametric tests like the t-test are not met, such as when the data is not normally distributed or when the variances are unequal."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"id":"10262be4-eaea-4223-ad15-0b6cc01f713b","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":52,"lastExecutedAt":1707327986050,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Combine women's and men's data and calculate goals scored in each match\nboth = pd.concat([women_subset, men_subset], axis=0, ignore_index=True)\n\nprint(both.head())","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":177,"type":"stream"}}},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Unnamed: 0</th>\n","      <th>date</th>\n","      <th>home_team</th>\n","      <th>away_team</th>\n","      <th>home_score</th>\n","      <th>away_score</th>\n","      <th>tournament</th>\n","      <th>group</th>\n","      <th>goals_scored</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>1600</td>\n","      <td>2003-09-20</td>\n","      <td>Nigeria</td>\n","      <td>North Korea</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>FIFA World Cup</td>\n","      <td>women</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>1601</td>\n","      <td>2003-09-20</td>\n","      <td>Norway</td>\n","      <td>France</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>FIFA World Cup</td>\n","      <td>women</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>1602</td>\n","      <td>2003-09-20</td>\n","      <td>Germany</td>\n","      <td>Canada</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>FIFA World Cup</td>\n","      <td>women</td>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>1603</td>\n","      <td>2003-09-20</td>\n","      <td>Japan</td>\n","      <td>Argentina</td>\n","      <td>6</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>FIFA World Cup</td>\n","      <td>women</td>\n","      <td>6</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>1604</td>\n","      <td>2003-09-21</td>\n","      <td>United States</td>\n","      <td>Sweden</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>FIFA World Cup</td>\n","      <td>women</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["   Unnamed: 0       date      home_team    away_team  home_score  away_score  \\\n","0        1600 2003-09-20        Nigeria  North Korea           0           3   \n","1        1601 2003-09-20         Norway       France           2           0   \n","2        1602 2003-09-20        Germany       Canada           4           1   \n","3        1603 2003-09-20          Japan    Argentina           6           0   \n","4        1604 2003-09-21  United States       Sweden           3           1   \n","\n","       tournament  group  goals_scored  \n","0  FIFA World Cup  women             3  \n","1  FIFA World Cup  women             2  \n","2  FIFA World Cup  women             5  \n","3  FIFA World Cup  women             6  \n","4  FIFA World Cup  women             4  "]},"execution_count":6,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# Combine women's and men's data and calculate goals scored in each match\n","both = pd.concat([women_subset, men_subset], axis=0, ignore_index=True)\n","\n","both.head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"66ea9ff2-0a66-4114-a345-4d4bd270bfd5","metadata":{},"source":["In order to perform the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test (using pingouin), we need to prepare the data.
